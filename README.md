# Kelsie's Portfolio

Take two! In this iteration of my portfolio, I've gone with a complete re-design. The nav bar now uses smooth transitions to move the user down the page to each section. The skills section has been updated to include all the programs and tools I've learned in the last 4 months. The works section includes fun CSS animations to seamlessly show project information. And a contact form has been embedded at the bottom so users can reach out to me without having to leave my page.
